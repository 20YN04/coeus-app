# Security

## Reporting

Found a vulnerability? Mail yentl.nerinckx@icloud.com — do not open a public issue.

## Acknowledgments

With thanks to the researchers who responsibly disclosed issues in Coeus:

- **Alessio Micciche** ([@AM1407](https://github.com/AM1407)) — reported the loopback CSRF (LLM-key overwrite + forced folder ingestion) and SSRF via URL ingestion, fixed in v0.6.1, plus a follow-up dependency & hardening review.

## CI security

- `security.yml` runs npm audit (`desktop/`) + `cargo audit` (`desktop/src-tauri/`) + `pip-audit` (the brein), gitleaks secret scanning, CodeQL (JS/TS + Python), and dependency review on PRs. Weekly schedule + on push/PR.
- `dependabot.yml` keeps npm, cargo, pip, and GitHub Actions patched. Actions can be pinned to commit SHAs and Dependabot will bump them.
- Workflows run least-privilege (`permissions: contents: read` by default; `contents: write` only on the release job) with `persist-credentials: false` and harden-runner egress auditing.

## Cutting a desktop release

The desktop app is **local-first**: each installer bundles the static kennisbank UI (`desktop/`) plus the PyInstaller brein sidecar (built at the repo root). No cloud URL is baked in — the app runs the brein locally on a loopback port.

1. (Per-client white-label, optional) set the repo variables `COEUS_TENANT_NAME`, `COEUS_TENANT_SLUG`, `COEUS_TENANT_ACCENT` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables). Unset → default Coeus branding. See `desktop/docs/per-client-build.md`.
2. Tag and push: `git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0`.
3. `desktop-release.yml` builds the brein sidecar per-OS, bundles it into the Tauri app, and creates a **draft** GitHub Release with the macOS (arm64) `.dmg` + Windows `.exe`/`.msi` attached. Review, then publish.

## Auto-update

The desktop app self-updates via Tauri v2's official updater (`tauri-plugin-updater`). Each installer is signed with a minisign keypair; the app ships the **public** key (embedded in `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` → `plugins.updater.pubkey`) and verifies every downloaded update against it, so a release can only be installed if it was signed with the matching private key.

**Flow:** push to `main` → tag `vX.Y.Z` → `desktop-release.yml` builds + signs the installers, emits each artifact's `.sig` and a `latest.json` manifest, and uploads them to the GitHub Release. The installed app polls `https://github.com/20YN04/coeus-app/releases/latest/download/latest.json`; the user clicks **Controleer op updates** in Instellingen → `check()` → `downloadAndInstall()` → `relaunch()`.

**Required CI secrets** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets):

- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` — the full contents of the minisign private key file generated with `npx @tauri-apps/cli signer generate`.
- `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` — the password chosen when generating the key (empty string if the key was generated without one).

The private key is **never committed** (`desktop/src-tauri/.tauri/` is gitignored). If it is lost, generate a new keypair, replace `plugins.updater.pubkey`, and ship a new release — older installs signed with the old key can no longer auto-update and must be reinstalled manually.

## Code signing (optional — builds are unsigned until configured)

### macOS notarisation

Add these repo secrets to sign + notarise the `.dmg` (otherwise Gatekeeper warns on first open):

- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE` — base64 of the Developer ID `.p12`
- `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` — e.g. `Developer ID Application: Naam (TEAMID)`
- `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD` (app-specific password), `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

Requires an Apple Developer account (€99/yr).

### Windows

Authenticode signing is configured in `desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` under `bundle.windows` (`certificateThumbprint` + `timestampUrl`), or via Azure Trusted Signing. Needs a code-signing certificate. Until configured, the `.exe`/`.msi` are unsigned (SmartScreen warns).
